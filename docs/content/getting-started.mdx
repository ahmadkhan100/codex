# Getting Started with OpenAI Codex CLI

Welcome to the OpenAI Codex CLI documentation! This guide will help you get up and running with Codex in just a few minutes.

## What is Codex CLI?

Codex CLI is a lightweight coding agent that runs in your terminal. It combines ChatGPT-level reasoning with the ability to:

- Execute code and shell commands
- Create and edit files
- Run tests and iterate on solutions
- Work with version control
- All while maintaining security through sandboxing

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Operating System**: macOS 12+, Ubuntu 20.04+/Debian 10+, or Windows 11 (via WSL2)
- **Node.js**: Version 18+ (for npm installation)
- **Git**: Version 2.23+ (optional but recommended)
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum (8GB recommended)

## Installation

Choose your preferred installation method:

### Using npm (Recommended)

```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

### Using Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew install codex
```

### Direct Binary Download

Download the latest binary from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/latest):

```bash
# Linux/macOS
curl -L https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/latest/download/codex-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o codex
chmod +x codex
sudo mv codex /usr/local/bin/

# Verify installation
codex --version
```

## Authentication

Codex supports two authentication methods:

### Option 1: OpenAI API Key

If you have an OpenAI API key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

> **Tip**: Add this to your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`) to persist across sessions.

### Option 2: OpenAI Account Login

If you have an OpenAI Plus or Pro account:

```bash
codex login
```

This will open a browser window for authentication and save your credentials to `~/.codex/auth.json`.

## Your First Codex Session

### Interactive Mode

Start an interactive session:

```bash
codex
```

You'll see a terminal UI where you can type prompts and interact with Codex in real-time.

### Single Command Mode

Run Codex with a specific task:

```bash
codex "create a Python script that generates fibonacci numbers"
```

### Full Auto Mode

Let Codex work autonomously with sandboxed execution:

```bash
codex --full-auto "build a todo list web app with React"
```

## Understanding Approval Modes

Codex offers different levels of autonomy:

- **Suggest Mode** (default): Prompts for approval before each action
- **Auto-Edit Mode**: Automatically approves file edits, prompts for commands
- **Full-Auto Mode**: Runs everything in a sandbox, only prompts on failures

```bash
# Auto-approve file edits only
codex --auto-edit "refactor this TypeScript code"

# Full autonomous mode with sandboxing
codex --full-auto "add unit tests to all components"
```

## Working with Images

Codex supports multimodal inputs. Pass images to help with implementation:

```bash
codex -i screenshot.png "implement this UI design"
codex --image mockup.jpg --image flow-diagram.png "build this feature"
```

## Project Documentation

Codex automatically looks for `AGENTS.md` files to understand your project:

1. `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` - Global instructions
2. `./AGENTS.md` - Project-specific guidance
3. `./path/to/feature/AGENTS.md` - Feature-specific context

Example `AGENTS.md`:

```markdown
# Project Guidelines

- Use TypeScript with strict mode
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Write tests for all new features
- Use conventional commits
```

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Code Refactoring

```bash
codex "refactor UserProfile component to use React hooks instead of class components"
```

### 2. Debugging

```bash
codex "debug why the login form is not submitting properly"
```

### 3. Test Generation

```bash
codex "write comprehensive unit tests for the auth module"
```

### 4. Documentation

```bash
codex "generate API documentation for all endpoints in routes/"
```

### 5. Code Reviews

```bash
codex "review this codebase for security vulnerabilities"
```

## Tips for Success

1. **Be Specific**: Clear, detailed prompts yield better results
2. **Iterative Approach**: Start with small tasks and build up
3. **Use Context**: Reference specific files or functions
4. **Leverage Project Docs**: Keep AGENTS.md files updated
5. **Review Changes**: Always review generated code before committing
